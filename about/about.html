            <p class="about-title"> Breathe.</p>
            <p class="about"> You're going to be okay. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Breathe and remember that you've been in this place before. 
                <br>
                <br>
                You've been uncomfortable and anxious and scared, and you've survived. Breathe and know that you can survive this too. 
                <br>
                <br>
                These feelings can't break you. 
                <br>
                <br>
                They're painful and debilitating, but you can sit with them and eventually, they will pass. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Maybe not immediately, but soon they'll fade and when they do, you'll look back at this moment and laugh for having doubted your resilience. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I know it feels unbrearable right now, but keep breathing. Again and again. 
                <br>
                <br>
                This will pass. I promiss it will pass.</p>
