            <p class="title">*The 4-4-8-4 BREATHING TECHNIQUE*</p>
            <h2>How does it help?</h2>
            <p>&#47;</p>
            <p>This technique is designed to help you relax, focus, and provide clarity of thought. </p>
            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>&#47;</p>
            <p>Your heart rate and blood pressure increase when you breath in and decrease when you breath out. So by exhaling for twice as long as you inhale, you’re effectively hitting your off switch.</p>
            <h2>Steps to follow:</h2>
            <p>&#47;</p>
            → Loosen up and sit comfortably.
            <br>
            → Breathe in through your nose to the count of four.
            <br>
            → Hold the breath to the count of four.
            <br>
            → Exhale through pursed lips to the count of eight.
            <br>
            → Hold your breath to the count of four.
            <br>
            → Repeat this process a couple of times till you feel present in the moment again.
